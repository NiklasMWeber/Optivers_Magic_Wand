# Optiver's Magic Wand

This is a brainteaser that was part of Optiver's recruiting process some time ago. The problem was the following:

## Problem

Harry Potter has to cross several signals when he walks from his home to school. Each of these signals operate independently. They alternate every 80 seconds between green light and red light. At each signal, there is a counter display that tells him how long it will be before the current signal light changes. Harry has a magic wand which lets him turn a signal from red to green instantaneously. However, this wand comes with limited battery life, so he can use it only for a specified number of times.

  a) If the total number of signals is 2 and Harry can use his magic wand only once, then what is the expected waiting time at the signals when Harry optimally walks from his home to school?
    
  b) What if the number of signals is 3 and Harry can use his magic wand only once?
   
  c) Can you write a code that takes as inputs the number of signals and the number of times Harry can use his magic wand, and outputs the expected waiting time?
